render layer
 -- add to the queue of drawables
 -- each drawable has a camera
 -- a camera has a viewport it targets
 -- order by
 -- for 2d - want to order by lowest to highest bottom of the sprite (sort), regardless of render state or anything else


render service per viewport? layers per viewport?

renderservice.begin()
renderservice.clear() render target = [color, depth, etc.]
-- for each viewport, for each camera, for each layer
apply viewport frusturm
apply camera projection & view matricies
layer2d.drawables.sort() (top Y sporting)
for each drawable
set world matrix
check frusturm of drawable (camera + viewport + world)
set effect & texture, set geo
draw
renderservice.swap()
